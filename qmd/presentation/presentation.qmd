## *Quarto*

- does not link between files,
- every presentation is separate,
- looks so much better than *bookdown*-presentations.

What version of *Quarto* do I have[@how]?

```
quarto check

```

## Setup

1. For every presentation a subfolder inside the subfolder *qmd*.

2. Link to the presentation in *js.js*:

```
  let nameOfPresentation = "<name-of-presentation>";
  createLink(div, "presentation-" + nameOfPresentation, nameOfPresentation + ".html", "<The title of the presentation>");

```

## Preparing for remote controlling

1. Cloning *multiplex* [@a2023_multiplex].

2.  In the *multiplex*'s folder:

    ```
    npm install reveal-multiplex
    
    ```
    
3.  Creating the service:

    ```
    sudo emacs /etc/systemd/system/multiplex.service
    
    ```
    
4.  Starting the server:

    ```
    sudo systemctl start multiplex.service
    
    ```

5. Directing traffic to port 1948 into the server machine.

## Remote controlling

1.  Configuring:

    ```
    format:
  revealjs:
    multiplex:
      url: 'http://manual-for-rstudio.tennis24.ee:1948/'
      secret: "16759825730498538629"
      socketId: "f3edf0ff0d09982e"
      
    ```

2. Opening the main presentation HyperText Markup Language file for the audience.

3. Opening the file with the ending "-speaker.html" for remote controlling.

  title = {Silent Teacher},
  url = {https://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/},
  urldate = {2022-09-29},
  organization = {silentteacher.toxicode.fr}
}

```

In the metadata:

```
    bibliography: <the-name-of-the-presentation>.bib

```

A reference:

```

```

@quarto

```
[@quarto]

```

[@quarto]
