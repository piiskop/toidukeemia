Abstract = {Objectives. To explore whether improvements in psychological well-being occur after increases in fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods. We examined longitudinal food diaries of 12 385 randomly sampled Australian adults over 2007, 2009, and 2013 in the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. We adjusted effects on incident changes in happiness and life satisfaction for people's changing incomes and personal circumstances. Results. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. They were up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points (for an increase of 8 portions a day), which is equal in size to the psychological gain of moving from unemployment to employment. Improvements occurred within 24 months. Conclusions. People's motivation to eat healthy food is weakened by the fact that physical health benefits accrue decades later, but well-being improvements from increased consumption of fruit and vegetables a},

  abstract = "Oxalic acid and its salts occur as end products of metabolism in
              a number of plant tissues. When these plants are eaten they may
              have an adverse effect because oxalates bind calcium and other
              minerals. While oxalic acid is a normal end product of mammalian
              metabolism, the consumption of additional oxalic acid may cause
              stone formation in the urinary tract when the acid is excreted in
              the urine. Soaking and cooking of foodstuffs high in oxalate will
              reduce the oxalate content by leaching. The mean daily intake of
              oxalate in English diets has been calculated to be 70-150 mg,
              with tea appearing to contribute the greatest proportion of
              oxalate in these diets; rhubarb, spinach and beet are other
              common high oxalate-content foods. Vegetarians who consume
              greater amounts of vegetables will have a higher intake of
              oxalates, which may reduce calcium availability. This may be an
              increased risk factor for women, who require greater amounts of
              calcium in the diet. In humans, diets low in calcium and high in
              oxalates are not recommended but the occasional consumption of
              high oxalate foods as part of a nuritious diet does not pose any
              particular problem.",
