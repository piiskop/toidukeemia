Abstract = {Objectives. To explore whether improvements in psychological well-being occur after increases in fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods. We examined longitudinal food diaries of 12 385 randomly sampled Australian adults over 2007, 2009, and 2013 in the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. We adjusted effects on incident changes in happiness and life satisfaction for people's changing incomes and personal circumstances. Results. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. They were up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points (for an increase of 8 portions a day), which is equal in size to the psychological gain of moving from unemployment to employment. Improvements occurred within 24 months. Conclusions. People's motivation to eat healthy food is weakened by the fact that physical health benefits accrue decades later, but well-being improvements from increased consumption of fruit and vegetables a},

Abstract = {The number of people in the UK who claim to be vegetarian has increased dramatically during the last half century; statistics from the Second World War suggest that 0.2% of the population were vegetarian in the 1940s and it is estimated that, in 2000, between 3 and 7% of the population were vegetarian. There is much interest in the potential effects of plant-based diets on a range of health outcomes and nutrition. A range of dietary practices followed by vegetarians has been identified, from the strict guidelines of the most restrictive macrobiotic diets, through vegan and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, to those that occasionally include fish or even chicken. The type of vegetarian diet followed by an individual may reflect the motive to be vegetarian; motives for being vegetarian include, amongst others, ethical and ecological issues, health concerns, sensory and taste preferences and philosophical teachings. In addition to dietary choice patterns, vegetarians may differ from meat-eater},

abstract={Dietary carbohydrates are a group of chemically defined substances with a range of physical and physiological properties and health benefits. As with other macronutrients, the primary classification of dietary carbohydrate is based on chemistry, that is character of individual monomers, degree of polymerization (DP) and type of linkage ($\alpha$ or $\beta$), as agreed at the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Consultation in 1997. This divides carbohydrates into three main groups, sugars (DP 1--2), oligosaccharides (short-chain carbohydrates) (DP 3--9) and polysaccharides (DP⩾10). Within this classification, a number of terms are used such as mono- and disaccharides, polyols, oligosaccharides, starch, modified starch, non-starch polysaccharides, total carbohydrate, sugars, etc. While effects of carbohydrates are ultimately related to their primary chemistry, they are modified by their physical properties. These include water solubility, hydration, gel formation, crystalline state, association with other molecules such as protein, lipid and divalent cations and aggregation into complex structures in cell walls and other specialized plant tissues. A classification based on chemistry is essential for a system of measurement, predication of properties and estimation of intakes, but does not allow a simple translation into nutritional effects since each class of carbohydrate has overlapping physiological properties and effects on health. This dichotomy has led to the use of a number of terms to describe carbohydrate in foods, for example intrinsic and extrinsic sugars, prebiotic, resistant starch, dietary fibre, available and unavailable carbohydrate, complex carbohydrate, glycaemic and whole grain. This paper reviews these terms and suggests that some are more useful than others. A clearer understanding of what is meant by any particular word used to describe carbohydrate is essential to progress in translating the growing knowledge of the physiological properties of carbohydrate into public health messages.},

  abstract = "Oxalic acid and its salts occur as end products of metabolism in
              a number of plant tissues. When these plants are eaten they may
              have an adverse effect because oxalates bind calcium and other
              minerals. While oxalic acid is a normal end product of mammalian
              metabolism, the consumption of additional oxalic acid may cause
              stone formation in the urinary tract when the acid is excreted in
              the urine. Soaking and cooking of foodstuffs high in oxalate will
              reduce the oxalate content by leaching. The mean daily intake of
              oxalate in English diets has been calculated to be 70-150 mg,
              with tea appearing to contribute the greatest proportion of
              oxalate in these diets; rhubarb, spinach and beet are other
              common high oxalate-content foods. Vegetarians who consume
              greater amounts of vegetables will have a higher intake of
              oxalates, which may reduce calcium availability. This may be an
              increased risk factor for women, who require greater amounts of
              calcium in the diet. In humans, diets low in calcium and high in
              oxalates are not recommended but the occasional consumption of
              high oxalate foods as part of a nuritious diet does not pose any
              particular problem.",

Abstract = {Raw vegetarian food and life reform: Maximilian Bircher-Benner and the Swedish health foods movements. By Motzi Eklöf. Movements for life reform, natural healing, and health foods have persisted in Sweden since the last decades of the 19th century. Stressing the importance of less alcohol and other drugs, a proper diet, and the use of natural healing methods, they have displayed conflicts concerning individual rights to decide in matters concerning one’s own body and health in relation to a medicine and state demands. Swedish movements for natural healing and health foods have developed under influence from leading figures and movements in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, North America, and England.In 1900, the Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner (1867–1939) launched his theory of ”sunlight food”, meaning that uncooked vegetables and fruits were containing the most energy, whereas meat was radically less nourishing. His theories were contrary to contemporary medical and bourgeois c},
